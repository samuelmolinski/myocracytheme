The Script that generates the actual share buttons/bars is hosted on cunjo.com server and is a Free Service provided by cunjo.com. You have to register for a Free !Share ID and agree with our Terms and Conditions.

PS: You'll need a FREE !Share ID to use it. Once you generate the ID from your !Share General Settings, check your email and copy the share ID from the cunjo email received. Paste the code in the General Settings form and save.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I already have a !Share ID from cunjo.com/share, can I use that one? =

Yes. If you previously generated a !Share ID from our website you can use it on your plugin. Insert the id in the General Settings form after installation and the system will approve it.

= Can I use my !Share ID on multiple wordpress installations? =

Yes. Your !Share ID is Universal. You can Use it on as many blogs as you like.

= Can I use both the Share Bar and inline share buttons in the same time? =

Yes. With the !Share plugin you can use both share widget styles.

= Can I design and use more that one !Share Bar in the same time on a blog? =

Yes, unlike versions prior 2.0 you can now use ONE of EACH widget per page.

= My Share bar is not showing on my blog, what might be the issue? =

The plugin is 100% built and integrated with wordpress functionalities, functions and hooks. The first guess might be that you have a buggy plugin in conflict with ours. Try to spot that plugin by deactivating each of your plugins one at a time and each time refresh your blog page, if after deactivating a plugin the !Share bar appears on your blog it means you found the buggy plugin. If nothing works contact the Cunjo Support team at support@cunjo.com and we will take a look for you.
